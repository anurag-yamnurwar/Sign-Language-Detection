# hand-gesture-recognition-using-mediapipe
Hand pose using MediaPipe (Python version).<br> This is a sample 
program that recognizes hand signs and finger gestures with a simple MLP using the detected key points.

Detection confidence threshold (Default：0.5)
* --min_tracking_confidence<br>
Tracking confidence threshold (Default：0.5)

### app.py
This is a sample program for inference.<br>
In addition, learning data (key points) for hand sign recognition,<br>
You can also collect training data (index finger coordinate history) for finger gesture recognition.

### keypoint_classification.ipynb
This is a model training script for hand sign recognition.

### point_history_classification.ipynb
This is a model training script for finger gesture recognition.

### model/keypoint_classifier
This directory stores files related to hand sign recognition.<br>
The following files are stored.
* Training data(keypoint.csv)
* Trained model(keypoint_classifier.tflite)
* Label data(keypoint_classifier_label.csv)
* Inference module(keypoint_classifier.py)

### model/point_history_classifier
This directory stores files related to finger gesture recognition.<br>
The following files are stored.
* Training data(point_history.csv)
* Trained model(point_history_classifier.tflite)
* Label data(point_history_classifier_label.csv)
* Inference module(point_history_classifier.py)

### utils/cvfpscalc.py
This is a module for FPS measurement.

# Training
Hand sign recognition and finger gesture recognition can add and change training data and retrain the model.
